# 2.1.1. 口型（Mouth shape）

元音发声时，气流从肺部通过声门冲击**声带**，使其均匀振动，而后通过起着共鸣器作用的口腔，无阻力地呼出。

For vowel pronunciation, the airflow from your lungs strikes against your *vocal cords* through the glottis. This produces a consistent vibration that is amplified as it travels unimpeded through your mouth - the resonator cavity - before being expelled freely.

生成不同元音的主要器官是嘴唇，这也是婴幼儿在学说话时所能观察到的唯一发声器官。张嘴的另外一个器官是下巴，下巴拉开，口型变大。

Notably, a prime organ involved here: lips - the only visible speech articulator observable when infants are learning to speak. Another organ that opens the mouth is the jaw, which, when pulled apart, enlarges the shape of the mouth.

以下是  5 个基础元音发声时的口型（嘴唇位置）：

Here are the mouth shapes (or, lips positions) during enunciation of five basic vowels:

当然，除了嘴唇的形状之外，影响元音发声的器官还有舌面的位置、软腭的动作 —— 影响口腔内气流共振的空间 —— 不过，由于人类语言的相通属性，人们在这些基础元音的发声上都没有任何困难。

Certainly, besides the mouth, other articulators influencing vowel pronunciation include where tongue lies and what's happening with soft palate, forming  a specific space that affects the resonance of airflow in the mouth. But thanks to universal linguistic attributes in humans, no one really struggles when it comes down to these basic vowels.

另外，英文的 <span class="pho">ə</span> 口型与 <span class="pho">e</span> 接近；而 <span class="pho">æ</span> 的口型比 <span class="pho">e</span> 的大一点、比 <span class="pho">ɑ</span> 的小一点。

Moreover, regarding English phonetics: the mouth shape for <span class="pho">ə</span> is similar to that for <span class="pho">e</span>, whereas for <span class="pho">æ</span>, a slightly larger opening is formed than when saying <span class="pho">e</span>, but smaller one compared with pronouncing <span class="pho">ɑ</span>.
